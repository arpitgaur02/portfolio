# Arpit's Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with **Gatsby** and **React**.

I customized this site to showcase my work in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **AI Engineering**.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Gatsby (React)
- **Styling:** Styled Components
- **Hosting:** Vercel / GitHub Pages
- **Animation:** Anime.js

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/v4.git](https://github.com/yourusername/v4.git)
   cd v4



   This website is customized from the v4 template created by Brittany Chiang.

## CREDITS
**Why this matters**
* **It shows ownership:** It proves you understand the code you are hosting.
* **It respects the license:** Keeping the "Credits" section is the professional way to use open-source templates.
* **It looks clean:** When you pin this repo to your GitHub profile, the preview will look professional.
